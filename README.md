## Hi there 👋, I’m Wenbo Li

- 🔭 I am currently a Phd student at *University of Pavia*.
- 🏄 My research interests lie in **Urban Remote Sensing**, with a primary focus on *Urban Green Space* and *Surface Urban Heat Island*.
- 🔬 Currently, my research focuses on the development of deep learning approaches for extracting urban green spaces and analysing their spatiotemporal dynamics and associated ecological functions.
- 😄 I look forward to working with friends of all backgrounds to
  explore the fun of **remote sensing** and **programming**!
